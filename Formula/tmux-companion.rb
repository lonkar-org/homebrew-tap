# it publishes a release. Sixty-four zeros in a sha256 line, or
# PLACEHOLDER-UNTIL-FIRST-RELEASE beside the version, mean no release has filled
# that line in yet, and `brew install` fails the checksum rather than installing
# something nobody verified.

      The binary binds no keys and sets no tmux options. For the status bar:

        set -g status-right "#(tmux-companion status-right --branch-max-len 40 \#{pane_current_path})"

      `tmux-companion doctor` prints what a bug report needs.
